Deploy Swift Lambda functions on Amazon EC2 instances with concurrent execution support

## Overview

Lambda Managed Instances enables you to run Lambda functions on your current-generation Amazon EC2 instances while maintaining serverless simplicity. AWS handles all infrastructure management tasks including instance lifecycle, OS and runtime patching, routing, load balancing, and auto-scaling, while you benefit from EC2 flexibility and cost optimization.

The key difference from traditional Lambda is concurrent execution support: multiple invocations can run simultaneously within the same execution environment on the same EC2 host.

### When to Use Lambda Managed Instances

Lambda Managed Instances are ideal for:

- **Sustained workloads** where cost optimization through EC2 pricing models provides better economics than traditional Lambda
- **Specialized compute requirements** needing specific EC2 instance types such as Graviton4 or network-optimized instances
- **High-throughput scenarios** where concurrent execution on the same host improves performance and resource utilization
- **Workloads requiring EC2 flexibility** while maintaining serverless operational simplicity

### Code Changes Required

Migrating existing Lambda functions to Lambda Managed Instances requires two simple changes:

#### 1. Use `LambdaManagedRuntime` Instead of `LambdaRuntime`

Replace your standard `LambdaRuntime` initialization with `LambdaManagedRuntime`:

```swift
import AWSLambdaRuntime

// Before (standard Lambda)
let runtime = LambdaRuntime {
    (event: HelloRequest, context: LambdaContext) in
    HelloResponse(greetings: "Hello \(event.name)!")
}

// After (Lambda Managed Instances)
let runtime = LambdaManagedRuntime {
    (event: HelloRequest, context: LambdaContext) in
    HelloResponse(greetings: "Hello \(event.name)!")
}

try await runtime.run()
```

#### 2. Ensure Handlers Conform to `Sendable`

Because Lambda Managed Instances support concurrent invocations, your handler functions and structs must conform to the `Sendable` protocol to ensure thread safety:

```swift
import AWSLambdaRuntime

// Handler struct must explicitly conform to Sendable
struct MyHandler: LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler, Sendable {
    typealias Event = MyRequest
    typealias Output = MyResponse
    
    func handle(
        _ event: Event,
        outputWriter: some LambdaResponseWriter<Output>,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws {
        try await outputWriter.write(MyResponse(message: "Processed"))
    }
}

// Use LambdaCodableAdapter to pass the handler to LambdaManagedRuntime
let adapter = LambdaCodableAdapter(handler: MyHandler())
let runtime = LambdaManagedRuntime(handler: adapter)
try await runtime.run()
```

For simple data structures, the Swift compiler automatically infers `Sendable` conformance, but explicitly declaring it is recommended for clarity and safety.

### How It Works

The runtime automatically detects the configured concurrency level through the `AWS_LAMBDA_MAX_CONCURRENCY` environment variable and launches the appropriate number of Runtime Interface Clients (RICs) to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

When `AWS_LAMBDA_MAX_CONCURRENCY` is 1 or unset, the runtime maintains single-threaded behavior for optimal performance on traditional Lambda deployments, ensuring backward compatibility.

The managed instances support is implemented behind a Swift package trait (`ManagedRuntimeSupport`) that's enabled by default. If you're concerned about binary size and don't need managed instances support, you can disable this specific trait in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/awslabs/swift-aws-lambda-runtime.git",
        from: "2.0.0",
        traits: [
            // Keep other default traits but exclude ManagedRuntimeSupport
            "FoundationJSONSupport",
            "ServiceLifecycleSupport",
            "LocalServerSupport"
        ]
    ),
],
targets: [
    .executableTarget(
        name: "MyLambda",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "AWSLambdaRuntime", package: "swift-aws-lambda-runtime"),
        ]
    ),
]
```

### Prerequisites

Before deploying to Lambda Managed Instances:

1. Create a [Lambda Managed Instances capacity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-managed-instances-capacity-providers.html) in your AWS account
2. Configure your deployment to reference the capacity provider ARN

### Example Functions

The Swift AWS Lambda Runtime includes three comprehensive examples demonstrating Lambda Managed Instances capabilities:

- **HelloJSON**: JSON input/output with structured data types and concurrent execution
- **Streaming**: Response streaming with concurrent invocation handling
- **BackgroundTasks**: Long-running background processing after response with concurrency support

See the [ManagedInstances example directory](https://github.com/awslabs/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/tree/main/Examples/ManagedInstances) for complete deployment instructions using AWS SAM.
