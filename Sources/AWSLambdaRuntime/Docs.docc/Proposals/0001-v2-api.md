# v2 API proposal for swift-aws-lambda-runtime

`swift-aws-lambda-runtime` is an important library for the Swift on Server ecosystem. The initial API was written before
async/await was introduced to Swift. When async/await was introduced, shims were added to bridge between the underlying
SwiftNIO `EventLoop` interfaces and async/await. However, just like `gRPC-swift` and `postgres-nio`, we now want to
shift to solely using async/await instead of `EventLoop` interfaces. For this, large parts of the current API have to be
reconsidered.

## Overview

Versions:

- v1 (2024-08-07): Initial version
- v1.1:
  - Remove the `reportError(_:)` method from `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` and instead make the `handle(...)` method of
    `StreamingLambdaHandler` throwing.
  - Remove the `addBackgroundTask(_:)` method from `LambdaContext` due to structured concurrency concerns and introduce
    the `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler` protocol as a solution.
    - Introduce `LambdaHandlerAdapter`, which adapts handlers conforming to `LambdaHandler` with
      `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`.
    - Update `LambdaCodableAdapter` to now be generic over any handler conforming to
      `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler` instead of `LambdaHandler`.
- v1.2:
  - Remove `~Copyable` from `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` and `LambdaResponseWriter`. Instead throw an error when
    `finish()` is called multiple times or when `write`/`writeAndFinish` is called after `finish()`.

## Motivation

### Current Limitations

#### EventLoop interfaces

The current API extensively uses the `EventLoop` family of interfaces from SwiftNIO in many areas. To use these
interfaces correctly though, it requires developers to exercise great care and understand the various transform methods
that are used to work with `EventLoop`s and `EventLoopFuture`s. This results in a lot of cognitive complexity and makes
the code in the current API hard to reason about and maintain. For these reasons, the overarching trend in the Swift on
Server ecosystem is to shift to newer, more readable, Swift concurrency constructs and de-couple from SwiftNIO's
`EventLoop` interfaces.

#### No ownership of the main() function

A Lambda function can currently be implemented through conformance to the various handler protocols defined in
``AWSLambdaRuntime/LambdaHandler``. Each of these protocols have an extension which implements a `static func main()`.
This allows users to annotate their `LambdaHandler` conforming object with `@main`. The `static func main()` calls the
internal `Lambda.run()` function, which starts the Lambda function. Since the `Lambda.run()` method is internal, users
cannot override the default implementation. This has proven challenging for users who want to
[set up global properties before the Lambda starts-up](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/issues/265).
Setting up global properties is required to customize the Swift Logging, Metric and Tracing backend.

#### Non-trivial transition from SimpleLambdaHandler to LambdaHandler

The `SimpleLambdaHandler` protocol provides a quick and easy way to implement a basic Lambda function. It only requires
an implementation of the `handle` function where the business logic of the Lambda function can be written.
`SimpleLambdaHandler` is perfectly sufficient for small use-cases as the user does not need to spend much time looking
into the library.

However, `SimpleLambdaHandler` cannot be used when services such as a database client need to be initialized before the
Lambda runtime starts and then also gracefully shutdown prior to the runtime terminating. This is because the only way
to register termination logic is through the `LambdaInitializationContext` (containing a field
`terminator: LambdaTerminator`) which is created and used _internally_ within `LambdaRuntime` and never exposed through
`SimpleLambdaHandler`. For such use-cases, other handler protocols like `LambdaHandler` must be used. `LambdaHandler`
exposes a `context` argument of type `LambdaInitializationContext` through its initializer. Within the initializer,
required services can be initialized and their graceful shutdown logic can be registered with the
`context.terminator.register` function.

Yet, `LambdaHandler` is quite cumbersome to use in such use-cases as users have to deviate from the established norms of
the Swift on Server ecosystem in order to cleanly manage the lifecycle of the services intended to be used. This is
because the convenient `swift-service-lifecycle` v2 library — which is commonly used for cleanly managing the lifecycles
of required services and widely supported by many libraries — cannot be used in a structured concurrency manner.

#### Does not integrate well with swift-service-lifecycle in a structured concurrency manner

The Lambda runtime can only be started using the **internal** `Lambda.run()` function. This function is called by the
`main()` function defined by the `LambdaHandler` protocol, preventing users from injecting initialized services into the
runtime _prior_ to it starting. As shown below, this forces users to use an **unstructured concurrency** approach and
manually initialize services, leading to the issue of the user then perhaps forgetting to gracefully shutdown the
initialized services:

```swift
struct MyLambda: LambdaHandler {
    let pgClient: PostgresClient

    init(context: AWSLambdaRuntime.LambdaInitializationContext) async throws {
        /// Instantiate service
        let client = PostgresClient(configuration: ...)

        /// Unstructured concurrency to initialize the service
        let pgTask = Task {
            await client.run()
        }

        /// Store the client in `self` so that it can be used in `handle(...)`
        self.pgClient = client

        /// !!! Must remember to explicitly register termination logic for PostgresClient !!!
        context.terminator.register(
           name: "PostgreSQL Client",
           handler: { eventLoop in
               pgTask.cancel()
               return eventLoop.makeFutureWithTask {
                  await pgTask.value
               }
           }
        )
    }

    func handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output {
        /// Use the initialized service stored in `self.pgClient`
        try await self.pgClient.query(...)
    }
}
```

#### Verbose Codable support

In the current API, there are extensions and Codable wrapper classes for decoding events and encoding computed responses
for _each_ different handler protocol and for both `String` and `JSON` formats. This has resulted in a lot of
boilerplate code which can very easily be made generic and simplified in v2.

### New features

#### Support response streaming

In April 2023
[AWS introduced support for response streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/)
in Lambda. The current API does not support streaming. For v2 we want to change this.

#### Scheduling background work

In May
[AWS described in a blog post that you can run background tasks in Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-code-after-returning-a-response-from-an-aws-lambda-function/)
until the runtime asks for more work from the control plane. We want to support this by adding new API that allows
background processing, even after the response has been returned.

## Proposed Solution

### async/await-first API

Large parts of `Lambda`, `LambdaHandler`, and `LambdaRuntime` will be re-written to use async/await constructs in place
of the `EventLoop` family of interfaces.

### Providing ownership of main() and support for swift-service-lifecycle

- Instead of conforming to a handler protocol, users can now create a `LambdaRuntime` by passing in a handler closure.
- `LambdaRuntime` conforms to `ServiceLifecycle.Service` by implementing a `run()` method that contains initialization
  and graceful shutdown logic.
- This allows the lifecycle of the `LambdaRuntime` to be managed with `swift-service-lifecycle` _alongside_ and in the
  same way the lifecycles of the required services are managed, e.g.
  `try await ServiceGroup(services: [postgresClient, ..., lambdaRuntime], ...).run()`.
- Dependencies can now be injected into `LambdaRuntime`. With `swift-service-lifecycle`, services will be initialized
  together with `LambdaRuntime`.
- The required services can then be used within the handler in a structured concurrency manner.
  `swift-service-lifecycle` takes care of listening for termination signals and terminating the services as well as the
  `LambdaRuntime` in correct order.
- `LambdaTerminator` can now be eliminated because its role is replaced with `swift-service-lifecycle`. The termination
  logic of the Lambda function will be implemented in the conforming `run()` function of `LambdaRuntime`.

With this, the earlier code snippet can be replaced with something much easier to read, maintain, and debug:

```swift
/// Instantiate services
let postgresClient = PostgresClient()

/// Instantiate LambdaRuntime with a closure handler implementing the business logic of the Lambda function
let runtime = LambdaRuntime { (event: Input, context: LambdaContext) in
    /// Use initialized service within the handler
    try await postgresClient.query(...)
}

/// Use ServiceLifecycle to manage the initialization and termination
/// of the services as well as the LambdaRuntime
let serviceGroup = ServiceGroup(
    services: [postgresClient, runtime],
    configuration: .init(gracefulShutdownSignals: [.sigterm]),
    logger: logger
)
try await serviceGroup.run()
```

### Simplifying Codable support

A detailed explanation is provided in the **Codable Support** section. In short, much of the boilerplate code defined
for each handler protocol in `Lambda+Codable` and `Lambda+String` will be replaced with a single `LambdaCodableAdapter`
struct.

This adapter struct is generic over (1) any handler conforming to a new handler protocol
`LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`, (2) the user-specified input and output types, and (3) any decoder and encoder
conforming to protocols `LambdaEventDecoder` and `LambdaOutputDecoder`. The adapter will wrap the underlying handler
with encoding/decoding logic.

## Detailed Solution

Below are explanations for all types that we want to use in AWS Lambda Runtime v2.

### LambdaResponseStreamWriter

We will introduce a new `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` protocol. It is used in the new `StreamingLambdaHandler` (defined
below), which is the new base protocol for the `LambdaRuntime` (defined below as well).

```swift
/// A writer object to write the Lambda response stream into
public protocol LambdaResponseStreamWriter {
    /// Write a response part into the stream. The HTTP response is started lazily before the first call to `write(_:)`.
    /// Bytes written to the writer are streamed continually.
    func write(_ buffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
    /// End the response stream and the underlying HTTP response.
    func finish() async throws
    /// Write a response part into the stream and end the response stream as well as the underlying HTTP response.
    func writeAndFinish(_ buffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
}
```

If the user does not call `finish()`, the library will automatically finish the stream after the last `write`.
Appropriate errors will be thrown if `finish()` is called multiple times, or if `write`/`writeAndFinish` is called after
`finish()`.

### LambdaContext

`LambdaContext` will be largely unchanged, but the `eventLoop` property will be removed. The `allocator` property of
type `ByteBufferAllocator` will also be removed because (1), we generally want to reduce the number of SwiftNIO types
exposed in the API, and (2), `ByteBufferAllocator` does not optimize the allocation strategies. The common pattern
observed across many libraries is to re-use existing `ByteBuffer`s as much as possible. This is also what we do for the
`LambdaCodableAdapter` (explained in the **Codable Support** section) implementation.

```swift
/// A context object passed as part of an invocation in LambdaHandler handle functions.
public struct LambdaContext: Sendable {
    /// The request ID, which identifies the request that triggered the function invocation.
    public var requestID: String { get }

    /// The AWS X-Ray tracing header.
    public var traceID: String { get }

    /// The ARN of the Lambda function, version, or alias that's specified in the invocation.
    public var invokedFunctionARN: String { get }

    /// The timestamp that the function times out.
    public var deadline: DispatchWallTime { get }

    /// For invocations from the AWS Mobile SDK, data about the Amazon Cognito identity provider.
    public var cognitoIdentity: String? { get }

    /// For invocations from the AWS Mobile SDK, data about the client application and device.
    public var clientContext: String? { get }

    /// `Logger` to log with.
    ///
    /// - note: The `LogLevel` can be configured using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
    public var logger: Logger { get }
}
```

### Handlers

We introduce three handler protocols: `StreamingLambdaHandler`, `LambdaHandler`, and
`LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`.

#### StreamingLambdaHandler

The new `StreamingLambdaHandler` protocol is the base protocol to implement a Lambda function. Most users will not use
this protocol and instead use the `LambdaHandler` protocol defined below.

```swift
/// The base StreamingLambdaHandler protocol
public protocol StreamingLambdaHandler {
    /// The business logic of the Lambda function
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - event: The invocation's input data
    ///   - responseWriter: A ``LambdaResponseStreamWriter`` to write the invocation's response to.
    ///                     If no response or error is written to the `responseWriter` it will
    ///                     report an error to the invoker.
    ///   - context: The LambdaContext containing the invocation's metadata
    /// - Throws:
    /// How the thrown error will be handled by the runtime:
    ///   - An invocation error will be reported if the error is thrown before the first call to
    ///     ``LambdaResponseStreamWriter.write(_:)``.
    ///   - If the error is thrown after call(s) to ``LambdaResponseStreamWriter.write(_:)`` but before
    ///     a call to ``LambdaResponseStreamWriter.finish()``, the response stream will be closed and trailing
    ///     headers will be sent.
    ///   - If ``LambdaResponseStreamWriter.finish()`` has already been called before the error is thrown, the
    ///     error will be logged.
    mutating func handle(_ event: ByteBuffer, responseWriter: some LambdaResponseStreamWriter, context: LambdaContext) async throws
}
```

Using this protocol requires the `handle` method to receive the incoming event as a `ByteBuffer` and return the output
as a `ByteBuffer` too.

Through the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter`, which is passed as an argument in the `handle` function, the **response can be
streamed** by calling the `write(_:)` function of the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` with partial data repeatedly before
finally closing the response stream by calling `finish()`. Users can also choose to return the entire output and not
stream the response by calling `writeAndFinish(_:)`.

This protocol also allows for background tasks to be run after a result has been reported to the AWS Lambda control
plane, since the `handle(...)` function is free to implement any background work after the call to
`responseWriter.finish()`.

The protocol is defined in a way that supports a broad range of use-cases. The handle method is marked as `mutating` to
allow handlers to be implemented with a `struct`.

An implementation that sends the number 1 to 10 every 500ms could look like this:

```swift
struct SendNumbersWithPause: StreamingLambdaHandler {
    func handle(
        _ event: ByteBuffer,
        responseWriter: some LambdaResponseStreamWriter,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws {
        for i in 1...10 {
            // Send partial data
            responseWriter.write(ByteBuffer(string: #"\#(i)\n\r"#))
            // Perform some long asynchronous work
            try await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(500))
        }
        // All data has been sent. Close off the response stream.
        responseWriter.finish()
    }
}
```

#### LambdaHandler:

This handler protocol will be the go-to choice for most use-cases because it is completely agnostic to any
encoding/decoding logic -- conforming objects simply have to implement the `handle` function where the input and return
types are Swift objects.

Note that the `handle` function does not receive a `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` as an argument. Response streaming is
not viable for `LambdaHandler` because the output has to be encoded prior to it being sent, e.g. it is not possible to
encode a partial/incomplete JSON string.

```swift
public protocol LambdaHandler {
    /// Generic input type
    /// The body of the request sent to Lambda will be decoded into this type for the handler to consume
    associatedtype Event
    /// Generic output type
    /// This is the return type of the handle() function.
    associatedtype Output

    /// The business logic of the Lambda function. Receives a generic input type and returns a generic output type.
    /// Agnostic to encoding/decoding
    mutating func handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output
}
```

#### LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler:

This protocol is exactly like `LambdaHandler`, with the only difference being the added support for executing background
work after the result has been sent to the AWS Lambda control plane.

This is achieved by not having a return type in the `handle` function. The output is instead written into a
`LambdaResponseWriter` that is passed in as an argument, meaning that the `handle` function is then free to implement
any background work after the result has been sent to the AWS Lambda control plane.

`LambdaResponseWriter` has different semantics to the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter`. Where the `write(_:)` function of
`LambdaResponseStreamWriter` means writing into a response stream, the `write(_:)` function of `LambdaResponseWriter`
simply serves as a mechanism to return the output without explicitly returning from the `handle` function.

```swift
public protocol LambdaResponseWriter<Output> {
    associatedtype Output

    /// Sends the generic Output object (representing the computed result of the handler)
    /// to the AWS Lambda response endpoint.
    /// An error will be thrown if this function is called more than once.
    func write(_: Output) async throws
}

public protocol LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler {
    /// Generic input type
    /// The body of the request sent to Lambda will be decoded into this type for the handler to consume
    associatedtype Event
    /// Generic output type
    /// This is the type that the handle() function will send through the ``LambdaResponseWriter``.
    associatedtype Output

    /// The business logic of the Lambda function. Receives a generic input type and returns a generic output type.
    /// Agnostic to JSON encoding/decoding
    func handle(
        _ event: Event,
        outputWriter: some LambdaResponseWriter<Output>,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws
}
```

##### Example Usage:

```swift
struct BackgroundProcessingHandler: LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler {
    struct Input: Decodable {
        let message: String
    }

    struct Greeting: Encodable {
        let echoedMessage: String
    }

    typealias Event = Input
    typealias Output = Greeting

    func handle(
        _ event: Event,
        outputWriter: some LambdaResponseWriter<Output>,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws {
        // Return result to the Lambda control plane
        try await outputWriter.write(result: Greeting(echoedMessage: event.messageToEcho))

        // Perform some background work, e.g:
        try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(10))

        // Exit the function. All asynchronous work has been executed before exiting the scope of this function.
        // Follows structured concurrency principles.
        return
    }
}
```

#### Handler Adapters

Since the `StreamingLambdaHandler` protocol is the base protocol the `LambdaRuntime` works with, there are adapters to
make both `LambdaHandler` and `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler` compatible with `StreamingLambdaHandler`.

1. `LambdaHandlerAdapter` accepts a `LambdaHandler` and conforms it to `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`. This is
   achieved by taking the generic `Output` object returned from the `handle` function of `LambdaHandler` and passing it
   to the `write(_:)` function of the `LambdaResponseWriter`.

2. `LambdaCodableAdapter` accepts a `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler` and conforms it to `StreamingLambdaHandler`.
   This is achieved by wrapping the `LambdaResponseWriter` with the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` provided by
   `StreamingLambdaHandler`. A call to the `write(_:)` function of `LambdaResponseWriter` is translated into a call to
   the `writeAndFinish(_:)` function of `LambdaResponseStreamWriter`.

Both `LambdaHandlerAdapter` and `LambdaCodableAdapter` are described in greater detail in the **Codable Support**
section.

To summarize, `LambdaHandler` can be used with the `LambdaRuntime` by first going through `LambdaHandlerAdapter` and
then through `LambdaCodableAdapter`. `LambdaWithBackgroundHandler` just requires `LambdaCodableAdapter`.

For the common JSON-in and JSON-out use-case, there is an extension on `LambdaRuntime` that abstracts away this wrapping
from the user.

### LambdaRuntime

`LambdaRuntime` is the class that communicates with the Lambda control plane as defined in
[Building a custom runtime for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html) and
forward the invocations to the provided `StreamingLambdaHandler`. It will conform to `ServiceLifecycle.Service` to
provide support for `swift-service-lifecycle`.

```swift
/// The LambdaRuntime object. This object communicates with the Lambda control plane
/// to fetch work and report errors.
public final class LambdaRuntime<Handler>: ServiceLifecycle.Service, Sendable
    where Handler: StreamingLambdaHandler
{

    /// Create a LambdaRuntime by passing a handler, an eventLoop and a logger.
    /// - Parameter handler: A ``StreamingLambdaHandler`` that will be invoked
    /// - Parameter eventLoop: An ``EventLoop`` on which the LambdaRuntime will be
    ///                        executed. Defaults to an EventLoop from
    ///                        ``NIOSingletons.posixEventLoopGroup``.
    /// - Parameter logger: A logger
    public init(
        handler: sending Handler,
        eventLoop: EventLoop = Lambda.defaultEventLoop,
        logger: Logger = Logger(label: "Lambda")
    )

    /// Create a LambdaRuntime by passing a ``StreamingLambdaHandler``.
    public convenience init(handler: sending Handler)

    /// Starts the LambdaRuntime by connecting to the Lambda control plane to ask
    /// for events to process. If the environment variable AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API is
    /// set, the LambdaRuntime will connect to the Lambda control plane. Otherwise
    /// it will start a mock server that can be used for testing at port 8080
    /// locally.
    /// Cancel the task that runs this function to close the communication with
    /// the Lambda control plane or close the local mock server. This function
    /// only returns once cancelled.
    public func run() async throws
}
```

The current API allows for a Lambda function to be tested locally through a mock server by requiring an environment
variable named `LOCAL_LAMBDA_SERVER_ENABLED` to be set to `true`. If this environment variable is not set, the program
immediately crashes as the user will not have the `AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API` environment variable on their local machine
(set automatically when deployed to AWS Lambda). However, making the user set the `LOCAL_LAMBDA_SERVER_ENABLED`
environment variable is an unnecessary step that can be avoided. In the v2 API, the `run()` function will automatically
start the mock server when the `AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API` environment variable cannot be found.

### Lambda

We also add an enum to store a static function and a property on. We put this on the static `Lambda` because
`LambdaRuntime` is generic and thus has bad ergonomics for static properties and functions.

```swift
enum Lambda {
    /// This returns the default EventLoop that a LambdaRuntime is scheduled on.
    /// It uses `NIOSingletons.posixEventLoopGroup.next()` under the hood.
    public static var defaultEventLoop: any EventLoop { get }

    /// Report a startup error to the Lambda Control Plane API
    public static func reportStartupError(any Error) async
}
```

Since the library now provides ownership of the `main()` function and allows users to initialize services before the
`LambdaRuntime` is initialized, the library cannot implicitly report
[errors that occur during initialization to the dedicated endpoint AWS exposes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html#runtimes-api-initerror)
like it currently does through the `initialize()` function of `LambdaRunner` which wraps the handler's `init(...)` and
handles any errors thrown by reporting it to the dedicated AWS endpoint.

To retain support for initialization error reporting, the `Lambda.reportStartupError(any Error)` function gives users
the option to manually report initialization errors in their closure handler. Although this should ideally happen
implicitly like it currently does in v1, we believe this is a small compromise in comparison to the benefits gained in
now being able to cleanly manage the lifecycles of required services in a structured concurrency manner.

> Use-case:
>
> Assume we want to load a secret for the Lambda function from a secret vault first. If this fails, we want to report
> the error to the control plane:
>
> ```swift
> let secretVault = SecretVault()
>
> do {
>    /// !!! Error thrown: secret "foo" does not exist !!!
>    let secret = try await secretVault.getSecret("foo")
>
>    let runtime = LambdaRuntime { (event: Input, context: LambdaContext) in
>        /// Lambda business logic
>    }
>
>    let serviceGroup = ServiceGroup(
>        services: [postgresClient, runtime],
>        configuration: .init(gracefulShutdownSignals: [.sigterm]),
>        logger: logger
>    )
>    try await serviceGroup.run()
> } catch {
>    /// Report startup error straight away to the dedicated initialization error endpoint
>    try await Lambda.reportStartupError(error)
> }
> ```

### Codable support

The `LambdaHandler` and `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler` protocols abstract away encoding/decoding logic from the
conformers as they are generic over custom `Event` and `Output` types. We introduce two adapters `LambdaHandlerAdapter`
and `CodableLambdaAdapter` that implement the encoding/decoding logic and in turn allow the respective handlers to
conform to `StreamingLambdaHandler`.

#### LambdaHandlerAdapter

Any handler conforming to `LambdaHandler` can be conformed to `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler` through
`LambdaHandlerAdapter`.

```swift
/// Wraps an underlying handler conforming to ``LambdaHandler``
/// with ``LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler``.
public struct LambdaHandlerAdapter<
    Event: Decodable,
    Output,
    Handler: LambdaHandler
>: LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler where Handler.Event == Event, Handler.Output == Output {
    let handler: Handler

    /// Register the concrete handler.
    public init(handler: Handler)

    /// 1. Call the `self.handler.handle(...)` with `event` and `context`.
    /// 2. Pass the generic `Output` object returned from `self.handler.handle(...)` to `outputWriter.write(_:)`
    public func handle(_ event: Event, outputWriter: some LambdaResponseWriter<Output>, context: LambdaContext) async throws
}
```

#### LambdaCodableAdapter

`LambdaCodableAdapter` accepts any generic underlying handler conforming to `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`. It
also accepts _any_ encoder and decoder object conforming to the `LambdaEventDecoder` and `LambdaOutputEncoder`
protocols:

##### LambdaEventDecoder and LambdaOutputEncoder protocols

```swift
public protocol LambdaEventDecoder {
    /// Decode the ByteBuffer representing the received event into the generic type Event
    /// the handler will receive
    func decode<Event: Decodable>(_ type: Event.Type, from buffer: ByteBuffer) throws -> Event
}

public protocol LambdaOutputEncoder {
    /// Encode the generic type Output the handler has produced into a ByteBuffer
    func encode<Output: Encodable>(_ value: Output, into buffer: inout ByteBuffer) throws
}
```

We provide conformances for Foundation's `JSONDecoder` to `LambdaEventDecoder` and `JSONEncoder` to
`LambdaOutputEncoder`.

`LambdaCodableAdapter` implements its `handle()` method by:

1.  Decoding the `ByteBuffer` event into the generic `Event` type.
2.  Wrapping the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` with a concrete `LambdaResponseWriter` such that calls to
    `LambdaResponseWriter`s `write(_:)` are mapped to `LambdaResponseStreamWriter`s `writeAndFinish(_:)`.
    - Note that the argument to `LambdaResponseWriter`s `write(_:)` is a generic `Output` object whereas
      `LambdaResponseStreamWriter`s `writeAndFinish(_:)` requires a `ByteBuffer`.
    - Therefore, the concrete implementation of `LambdaResponseWriter` also accepts an encoder. Its `write(_:)` function
      first encodes the generic `Output` object and then passes it to the underlying `LambdaResponseStreamWriter`.
3.  Passing the generic `Event` instance, the concrete `LambdaResponseWriter`, as well as the `LambdaContext` to the
    underlying handler's `handle()` method.

`LambdaCodableAdapter` can implement encoding/decoding for _any_ handler conforming to
`LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler` if `Event` is `Decodable` and the `Output` is `Encodable` or `Void`, meaning
that the encoding/decoding stubs do not need to be implemented by the user.

```swift
/// Wraps an underlying handler conforming to `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`
/// with encoding/decoding logic
public struct LambdaCodableAdapter<
    Handler: LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler,
    Event: Decodable,
    Output,
    Decoder: LambdaEventDecoder,
    Encoder: LambdaOutputEncoder
>: StreamingLambdaHandler where Handler.Output == Output, Handler.Event == Event {

    /// Register the concrete handler, encoder, and decoder.
    public init(
        handler: Handler,
        encoder: Encoder,
        decoder: Decoder
    ) where Output: Encodable

    /// For handler with a void output -- the user doesn't specify an encoder.
    public init(
        handler: Handler,
        decoder: Decoder
    ) where Output == Void, Encoder == VoidEncoder

    /// 1. Decode the invocation event using `self.decoder`
    /// 2. Create a concrete `LambdaResponseWriter` that maps calls to `write(_:)` with the `responseWriter`s `writeAndFinish(_:)`
    /// 2. Call the underlying `self.handler.handle()` method with the decoded event data, the concrete `LambdaResponseWriter`,
    /// and the `LambdaContext`.
    public mutating func handle(
        _ request: ByteBuffer,
        responseWriter: some LambdaResponseStreamWriter,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws
}
```

### Handler as a Closure

To create a Lambda function using the current API, a user first has to create an object and conform it to one of the
handler protocols by implementing the initializer and the `handle(...)` function. Now that `LambdaRuntime` is public,
this verbosity can very easily be simplified.

#### ClosureHandler

This handler is generic over any `Event` type conforming to `Decodable` and any `Output` type conforming to `Encodable`
or `Void`.

```swift
public struct ClosureHandler<Event, Output>: LambdaHandler {
    /// Initialize with a closure handler over generic Input and Output types
    public init(body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Output) where Output: Encodable
    /// Initialize with a closure handler over a generic Input type (Void Output).
    public init(body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Void) where Output == Void
    /// The business logic of the Lambda function.
    public func handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output
}
```

Given that `ClosureHandler` conforms to `LambdaHandler`:

1. We can extend the `LambdaRuntime` initializer such that it accepts a closure as an argument.
2. Within the initializer, the closure handler is wrapped with `LambdaCodableAdapter`.

```swift
extension LambdaRuntime {
    /// Initialize a LambdaRuntime with a closure handler over generic Event and Output types.
    /// This initializer bolts on encoding/decoding logic by wrapping the closure handler with
    /// LambdaCodableAdapter.
    public init<Event: Decodable, Output: Encodable>(
        body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Output
    ) where Handler == LambdaCodableAdapter<ClosureHandler<Event, Output>, Event, Output, JSONDecoder, JSONEncoder>

    /// Same as above but for handlers with a void output
    public init<Event: Decodable>(
        body: @escaping (Event, LambdaContext) async throws -> Void
    ) where Handler == LambdaCodableAdapter<ClosureHandler<Event, Void>, Event, Void, JSONDecoder, VoidEncoder>
}
```

We can now significantly reduce the verbosity and leverage Swift's trailing closure syntax to cleanly create and run a
Lambda function, abstracting away the decoding and encoding logic from the user:

```swift
/// The type the handler will use as input
struct Input: Decodable {
    var message: String
}

/// The type the handler will output
struct Greeting: Encodable {
    var echoedMessage: String
}

/// A simple Lambda function that echoes the input
let runtime = LambdaRuntime { (event: Input, context: LambdaContext) in
    Greeting(echoedMessage: event.message)
}

try await runtime.run()
```

We also add a `StreamingClosureHandler` conforming to `StreamingLambdaHandler` for use-cases where the user wants to
handle encoding/decoding themselves:

```swift
public struct StreamingClosureHandler: StreamingLambdaHandler {

    public init(
        body: @escaping sending (ByteBuffer, LambdaResponseStreamWriter, LambdaContext) async throws -> ()
    )

    public func handle(
        _ request: ByteBuffer,
        responseWriter: LambdaResponseStreamWriter,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws
}

extension LambdaRuntime {
    public init(
        body: @escaping sending (ByteBuffer, LambdaResponseStreamWriter, LambdaContext) async throws -> ()
    )
}
```

## Alternatives considered

### [UInt8] instead of ByteBuffer

We considered using `[UInt8]` instead of `ByteBuffer` in the base `LambdaHandler` API. We decided to use `ByteBuffer`
for two reasons.

1. 99% of use-cases will use the JSON codable API and will not directly get in touch with ByteBuffer anyway. For those
   users it does not matter if the base API uses `ByteBuffer` or `[UInt8]`.
2. The incoming and outgoing data must be in the `ByteBuffer` format anyway, as Lambda uses SwiftNIO under the hood and
   SwiftNIO uses `ByteBuffer` in its APIs. By using `ByteBuffer` we can save a copies to and from `[UInt8]`. This will
   reduce the invocation time for all users.
3. The base `LambdaHandler` API is most likely mainly being used by developers that want to integrate their web
   framework with Lambda (examples: Vapor, Hummingbird, ...). Those developers will most likely prefer to get the data
   in the `ByteBuffer` format anyway, as their lower level networking stack also depends on SwiftNIO.

### Users create a LambdaResponse, that supports streaming instead of being passed a LambdaResponseStreamWriter

Instead of passing the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` in the invocation we considered a new type `LambdaResponse`, that
users must return in the `StreamingLambdaHandler`.

Its API would look like this:

```swift
/// A response returned from a ``LambdaHandler``.
/// The response can be empty, a single ByteBuffer or a response stream.
public struct LambdaResponse {
    /// A writer to be used when creating a streamed response.
    public struct Writer {
        /// Writes data to the response stream
        public func write(_ byteBuffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
        /// Closes off the response stream
        public func finish() async throws
        /// Writes the `byteBuffer` to the response stream and subsequently closes the stream
        public func writeAndFinish(_ byteBuffer: ByteBuffer) async throws
    }

    /// Creates an empty lambda response
    public init()

    /// Creates a LambdaResponse with a fixed ByteBuffer.
    public init(_ byteBuffer: ByteBuffer)

    /// Creates a streamed lambda response. Use the ``Writer`` to send
    /// response chunks on the stream.
    public init(_ stream: @escaping sending (Writer) async throws -> ())
}
```

The `StreamingLambdaHandler` would look like this:

```swift
/// The base LambdaHandler protocol
public protocol StreamingLambdaHandler {
    /// The business logic of the Lambda function
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - event: The invocation's input data
    ///   - context: The LambdaContext containing the invocation's metadata
    /// - Returns: A LambdaResponse, that can be streamed
    mutating func handle(
        _ event: ByteBuffer,
        context: LambdaContext
    ) async throws -> LambdaResponse
}
```

There are pros and cons for the API that returns the `LambdaResponses` and there are pros and cons for the API that
receives a `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` as a parameter.

Concerning following structured concurrency principles the approach that receives a `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` as a
parameter has benefits as the lifetime of the handle function is tied to the invocation runtime. The approach that
returns a `LambdaResponse` splits the invocation into two separate function calls. First the handle method is invoked,
second the `LambdaResponse` writer closure is invoked. This means that it is impossible to use Swift APIs that use
`with` style lifecycle management patterns from before creating the response until sending the full response stream off.
For example, users instrumenting their lambdas with Swift tracing likely can not use the `withSpan` API for the full
lifetime of the request, if they return a streamed response.

However, if it comes to consistency with the larger Swift on server ecosystem, the API that returns a `LambdaResponse`
is likely the better choice. Hummingbird v2, OpenAPI and the new Swift gRPC v2 implementation all use this approach.
This might be due to the fact that writing middleware becomes easier, if a Response is explicitly returned.

We decided to implement the approach in which a `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` is passed to the function, since the
approach in which a `LambdaResponse` is returned can trivially be built on top of it. This is not true vice versa.

We welcome the discussion on this topic and are open to change our minds and API here.

### Adding a function `addBackgroundTask(_ body: sending @escaping () async -> ())` in `LambdaContext`

Initially we proposed an explicit `addBackgroundTask(_:)` function in `LambdaContext` that users could call from their
handler object to schedule a background task to be run after the result is reported to AWS. We received feedback that
this approach for supporting background tasks does not exhibit structured concurrency, as code could still be in
execution after leaving the scope of the `handle(...)` function.

For handlers conforming to the `StreamingLambdaHandler`, `addBackgroundTask(_:)` was anyways unnecessary as background
work could be executed in a structured concurrency manner within the `handle(...)` function after the call to
`LambdaResponseStreamWriter.finish()`.

For handlers conforming to the `LambdaHandler` protocol, we considered extending `LambdaHandler` with a
`performPostHandleWork(...)` function that will be called after the `handle` function by the library. Users wishing to
add background work can override this function in their `LambdaHandler` conforming object.

```swift
public protocol LambdaHandler {
    associatedtype Event
    associatedtype Output

    func handle(_ event: Event, context: LambdaContext) async throws -> Output

    func performPostHandleWork(...) async throws -> Void
}

extension LambdaHandler {
    // User's can override this function if they wish to perform background work
    // after returning a response from ``handle``.
    func performPostHandleWork(...) async throws -> Void {
        // nothing to do
    }
}
```

Yet this poses difficulties when the user wishes to use any state created in the `handle(...)` function as part of the
background work.

In general, the most common use-case for this library will be to implement simple Lambda functions that do not have
requirements for response streaming, nor to perform any background work after returning the output. To keep things easy
for the common use-case, and with Swift's principle of progressive disclosure of complexity in mind, we settled on three
handler protocols:

1. `LambdaHandler`: Most common use-case. JSON-in, JSON-out. Does not support background work execution. An intuitive
   `handle(event: Event, context: LambdaContext) -> Output` API that is simple to understand, i.e. users are not exposed
   to the concept of sending their response through a writer. `LambdaHandler` can be very cleanly implemented and used
   with `LambdaRuntime`, especially with `ClosureHandler`.
2. `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`: If users wish to augment their `LambdaHandler` with the ability to run
   background tasks, they can easily migrate. A user simply has to:
   1. Change the conformance to `LambdaWithBackgroundProcessingHandler`.
   2. Add an additional `outputWriter: some LambdaResponseWriter<Output>` argument to the `handle` function.
   3. Replace the `return ...` with `outputWriter.write(...)`.
   4. Implement any background work after `outputWriter.write(...)`.
3. `StreamingLambdaHandler`: This is the base handler protocol which is intended to be used directly only for advanced
   use-cases. Users are provided the invocation event as a `ByteBuffer` and a `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` where the
   computed result (as `ByteBuffer`) can either be streamed (with repeated calls to `write(_:)`) or sent all at once
   (with a single call to `writeAndFinish(_:)`). After closing the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter`, any background work can
   be implemented.

### Making LambdaResponseStreamWriter and LambdaResponseWriter ~Copyable

We initially proposed to make the `LambdaResponseStreamWriter` and `LambdaResponseWriter` protocols `~Copyable`, with
the functions that close the response having the `consuming` ownership keyword. This was so that the compiler could
enforce the restriction of not being able to interact with the writer after the response stream has closed.

However, non-copyable types do not compose nicely and add complexity for users. Further, for the compiler to actually
enforce the `consuming` restrictions, user's have to explicitly mark the writer argument as `consuming` in the `handle`
function.

Therefore, throwing appropriate errors to prevent abnormal interaction with the writers seems to be the simplest
approach.

## A word about versioning

We are aware that AWS Lambda Runtime has not reached a proper 1.0. We intend to keep the current implementation around
at 1.0-alpha. We don't want to change the current API without releasing a new major. We think there are lots of adopters
out there that depend on the API in v1. Because of this we intend to release the proposed API here as AWS Lambda Runtime
v2.
